# UFOs

## Project Overview
This project focuses on building a dynamcc webpage that accepts user inputs and adjusts accordingly to display information about UFO sightings. User can filter the UFO sightings table based on date, city, state, country and shape. 

## Results

All filter parameters can be entered simultaneously or individually.

## Summary
- One drawback of this design is the difficulty for the user to know what parameter to use for the filtering. For example to pick a city, the user would have to go through the table a find the city desired for the analysis.
- A way to address this would be to present drop-down lists including all filter values in place of the input fields.
Each list would need to update after a parameter is selected in any filter.
- Including a button to clear the filters is also needed. The button would be located below the last filter.
